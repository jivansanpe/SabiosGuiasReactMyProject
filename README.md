# Description of the home page I created

I have created a home page based on Tiburcio Cruz's project. I have designed a header and a footer. In the content of the page the mentors of the project and an image of one of the routes are shown.

# Third-party components I've used.

I have used FullWithGrid component to organize the page into sections.

# Own components that you have used.

Both the footer and the header are of my own invention.

# Links that have helped you.
